        <p>I am an Early Entry Master's student 
            studying Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte with a 
            concentration in Artificial Intelligence and Game Design. During my time as an undergraduate, I have had the pleasure of 
            being a teaching assistant for the Introductory Java Programming and Software Engineering courses 
            under Dr. Mohsen Dorodchi. I have also been involved in several research projects focused on the areas of 
            computing education. One such project is an NSF-funded research-practice partnership studying and promoting STEM education  
            in K-12 public schools.
